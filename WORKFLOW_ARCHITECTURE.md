# Workflow Coordination Architecture Design
## Autonomous Multi-Agent Orchestration System

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: July 28, 2025  
**Status**: Architectural Design Complete

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the autonomous workflow coordination architecture that intelligently routes requests through appropriate agents based on complexity and scope, with dynamic plan updates managed by the WBS execution engine.

**Key Innovation**: Eliminates hardcoded complexity levels in favor of **intelligent agent need assessment** with **dynamic workflow adaptation**.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Architecture Issues

**Current Flow (Suboptimal)**:
```
Request → workflow-agent (guesses workflow) → PM gets "Step 1" → Constrained execution
```

**Problems Identified**:
- ❌ workflow-agent creates workflows **without proper analysis**
- ❌ PM analysis gets **constrained** by workflow-agent's initial assumptions  
- ❌ Over-engineering for simple tasks (every request gets workflow treatment)
- ❌ Under-engineering for complex projects (workflow-agent can't predict scope)
- ❌ Static workflows that don't adapt as work progresses

---

## Proposed Architecture

### Core Principle: **Intelligent Routing + Dynamic Execution**

```
Request → Smart Assessment → Appropriate Route → Dynamic Adaptation
```

### Three-Tier Orchestration System

#### 1. **workflow-agent**: Intelligent Router & Standard Pattern Handler
**Role**: Request complexity assessment and routing decisions  
**Responsibilities**:
- Evaluate request scope and complexity
- Handle simple direct routes  
- Create standard workflow patterns
- Route complex requests to PM

#### 2. **project-manager-agent**: Complex System Analyzer & Custom Workflow Creator  
**Role**: Deep analysis and specialized workflow creation  
**Responsibilities**:
- Break down complex systems into components
- Analyze dependencies and phases
- Create custom JSON workflows with expert knowledge
- Hand optimized execution plans back to Main Claude

#### 3. **Main Claude**: Central Orchestrator & Context Manager
**Role**: Workflow execution and agent coordination  
**Responsibilities**:
- Execute workflows by calling agents in sequence
- Pass context and results between agents
- Manage overall coordination and handoffs
- Interface with WBS execution engine

## Autonomous Decision Logic

### workflow-agent Intelligence Matrix

```
Request Analysis → Smart Route Decision:

├─ SIMPLE (single action)
│   Example: "Fix typo in line 23"
│   → Direct to implementation-agent (no workflow.json needed)
│
├─ STANDARD FEATURE (known pattern) 
│   Example: "Add dark mode toggle"
│   → Create standard workflow: research → implementation → testing
│
└─ COMPLEX SYSTEM (unknown scope)
    Example: "Build user management system"
    → Route to PM for analysis → PM creates custom workflow
```

### Assessment Criteria

**Simple Route Indicators**:
- Single file edits, typo fixes, small changes
- Clear, bounded tasks with obvious implementation path

**Standard Pattern Indicators**:
- Feature requests with known implementation patterns
- Single-component functionality (dark mode, search, forms)
- Well-understood development workflows

**Complex Route Indicators**:
- Multi-component systems ("management system", "platform", "dashboard")
- Integration requirements ("with authentication", "and payment processing")
- Project-level requests ("build", "create complete", "full system")

---

## Execution Flows

### Flow A: Simple Direct Route
```
1. Request: "Fix typo in app.js line 23"
2. workflow-agent: "Simple edit - route directly"
3. Main Claude → implementation-agent (direct execution)
4. Complete (no workflow.json needed)
```

### Flow B: Standard Pattern Route  
```
1. Request: "Implement dark mode toggle"
2. workflow-agent: "Standard feature pattern"
3. workflow-agent creates: research → implementation → testing workflow
4. Main Claude executes workflow with WBS engine tracking
5. Dynamic updates as each step completes
```

### Flow C: Complex System Route
```
1. Request: "Build e-commerce platform with authentication, catalog, cart, payment"
2. workflow-agent: "Complex system - requires PM analysis"
3. Main Claude → project-manager-agent for breakdown
4. PM analyzes components, phases, dependencies
5. PM creates custom workflow.json with expert knowledge
6. PM hands workflow back to Main Claude
7. Main Claude executes workflow with WBS engine tracking
8. Dynamic updates and adaptive execution throughout
```

## Agent Roles & Responsibilities

### workflow-agent (Intelligent Router)
```yaml
Role: Universal orchestrator and pattern recognizer
Tools: Limited - analysis and routing focused
Behavior: 
  - NEVER does actual implementation work
  - Creates JSON workflows for standard patterns only
  - Routes complex requests to appropriate specialists
  - Maintains lightweight, fast decision-making
```

### project-manager-agent (Complex System Specialist)  
```yaml
Role: Deep analysis and custom workflow creation
Tools: Full Task Master MCP access, file operations
Behavior:
  - Breaks down complex systems into manageable components
  - Analyzes dependencies, phases, and resource requirements
  - Creates sophisticated JSON workflows with expert domain knowledge
  - Provides detailed context and specifications for execution
```

### Main Claude (Central Orchestrator)
```yaml
Role: Workflow execution and agent coordination
Behavior:
  - Receives workflow plans from workflow-agent or PM
  - Creates workflow.json files (triggers WBS hooks)
  - Executes agent calls in proper sequence
  - Manages context passing between agents
  - Coordinates with WBS engine for dynamic updates
```

## WBS Execution Engine Integration

### Dynamic Workflow Management

**Static Plan Creation** (workflow-agent or PM):
```json
{
  "task": "Build user management system",
  "steps": [
    {"id": 1, "agent": "research-agent", "depends_on": []},
    {"id": 2, "agent": "implementation-agent", "depends_on": [1]},
    {"id": 3, "agent": "testing-agent", "depends_on": [2]}
  ]
}
```

**Dynamic Execution Tracking** (WBS Engine):
```json
{
  "steps": [
    {"id": 1, "status": "completed", "result": "Architecture analysis complete..."},
    {"id": 2, "status": "in_progress", "result": null},
    {"id": 3, "status": "pending", "result": null}
  ],
  "execution_state": {
    "next_recommended": [2],
    "available_tasks": [2]
  }
}
```

### Hook-Driven Updates

**Automatic Workflow Updates**:
1. Agent completes task → Hook triggers
2. WBS engine updates task status and stores results  
3. WBS engine recalculates available tasks and dependencies
4. WBS engine provides next recommendations
5. Main Claude continues with updated plan

**Key Benefits**:
- ✅ **Real-time adaptation**: Plans adjust as work progresses
- ✅ **Dependency management**: Tasks only execute when prerequisites complete
- ✅ **Concurrency control**: Parallel execution with MAX_PARALLEL limits
- ✅ **Complete audit trail**: Full workflow history in workflow.json

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Update workflow-agent Logic
```markdown
<auto-selection-criteria>
Activate for requests requiring workflow coordination:
- Feature development needing multi-agent coordination
- Complex systems requiring breakdown and analysis  
- NOT simple edits or direct implementation tasks
- Includes complexity assessment and intelligent routing
</auto-selection-criteria>
```

### Phase 2: Enhance PM Workflow Creation
- Add JSON workflow creation capability to PM
- Ensure PM can create workflow.json in same format as workflow-agent
- Enable PM to provide detailed context and specifications

### Phase 3: Update Main Claude Orchestration
- Implement intelligent routing based on workflow-agent recommendations
- Create workflow execution loops with WBS engine integration
- Manage context passing and agent coordination

### Phase 4: WBS Engine Compatibility
