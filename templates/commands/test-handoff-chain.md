# Test Handoff Chain

Test the complete handoff automation mechanism using mock agents with real TaskMaster tasks.

## What This Tests

- DECISION.md auto-delegation mechanism  
- NEXT_ACTION.json context file creation
- Hook-based handoff detection
- Context reconstruction protocol
- TaskMaster integration with handoffs

## Test Scenario

Simulates the complete development workflow:
1. **Start**: mock-test-handoff-agent (reads tasks, initiates chain)
2. **Infrastructure**: mock-implementation-agent (Task 1 setup)  
3. **Component**: mock-component-implementation-agent (Task 2 TodoList)
4. **Testing**: mock-testing-agent (Task 4 Jest tests)
5. **Complete**: Full validation evidence

## Expected Evidence

After running, you should see:
- `.claude/handoff/NEXT_ACTION.json` files created at each step
- Hook logs showing handoff detection
- Automatic delegation without manual intervention
- Complete chain execution through all 4 agents

## Usage

```bash
# In Claude Code:
Use the mock-test-handoff-agent subagent to validate the complete handoff automation chain.
```

## Validation Points

1. **Context Files**: Check `.claude/handoff/` for NEXT_ACTION.json 
2. **Hook Logs**: Review `/tmp/test-driven-handoff.log` for detections
3. **Auto-Delegation**: Verify no manual intervention needed
4. **Chain Completion**: All 4 agents execute in sequence

## Success Criteria

✅ Each agent creates proper handoff syntax  
✅ Hook detects patterns and creates context files  
✅ Auto-delegation triggers correctly  
✅ Full chain completes without interruption  
✅ Real TaskMaster tasks used (not mock data)

This validates that our handoff mechanism works in cleared contexts and with real project data.
