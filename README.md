# Three-Tier Orchestration Architecture for Autonomous AI Development

## What it does

Transforms natural language requests into production-ready applications using a Three-Tier Orchestration Architecture with intelligent routing, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) execution engine, and 19 specialized AI agents.

### Three-Tier Architecture Overview

**Tier 1: Intelligent Routing (workflow-agent)**
- Analyzes request complexity and routes to appropriate execution path
- No hardcoded complexity levels - pure need-based assessment
- Three routing decisions: Direct → Standard Workflow → PM Analysis

**Tier 2: Project Management (project-manager-agent)**  
- Handles complex multi-component systems requiring expert breakdown
- Creates custom workflows with proper dependencies and phases
- Integrates with TaskMaster for enterprise project management

**Tier 3: Orchestration & Execution (Main Claude + WBS Engine)**
- Coordinates agent execution with dynamic plan updates
- Manages dependencies, parallel execution, and error recovery
- Real-time workflow state management with hook system

### Request Examples by Routing Pattern

**Direct Routing (Simple Tasks):**
```
"Fix the typo in line 23 of app.js"
"Add a comment explaining the calculateTotal function"  
"Update the button text from 'Submit' to 'Save'"
```

**Standard Workflow (Feature Development):**
```
"Add user login functionality with JWT authentication"
"Create a search feature for the product catalog"
"Implement dark mode toggle for the application"
```

**PM Analysis (Complex Systems):**
```
"Build a user management system with roles and permissions"
"Create an admin dashboard with analytics and user controls"
"Build an e-commerce platform with product catalog, cart, and payments"
```

**Result**: Complete applications with browser-tested functionality, zero JavaScript errors, enterprise-grade security, and accessibility compliance.

## How it works

### Intelligent Routing System

The **workflow-agent** performs complexity assessment and routing decisions:

**Route A: Direct Execution**
- Single file edits, typo fixes, clear bounded tasks
- Routes directly to implementation-agent (no workflow.json needed)
- Response: `{"routing": "direct", "agent": "implementation-agent", "reason": "Simple single-file edit"}`

**Route B: Standard Workflow**  
- Feature requests with known patterns, single-component functionality
- Creates standard JSON workflow (research → implementation → testing)
- Response: Complete workflow.json with dependency chain

**Route C: PM Analysis**
- Multi-component systems, integration requirements, project-level requests  
- Routes to project-manager-agent for expert breakdown
- Response: `{"routing": "pm_analysis", "reason": "Multi-component system requiring expert breakdown"}`

### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Execution Engine

Hook-based system (`.claude/hooks/workflow-coordinator.sh`) that:

**Workflow Management:**
- Creates and validates workflow.json files from agent responses
- Manages execution state with dependency resolution
- Supports parallel execution (MAX_PARALLEL=3)

**Dynamic Queue Management:**
- Identifies available tasks based on dependencies
- Updates execution recommendations in real-time
- Handles task completion and workflow state transitions

**Error Recovery:**
- JSON validation with exit code 2 blocking for malformed responses
- Automatic retry logic with configurable rules
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Agent Coordination

**Stateless Design:** Agents are stateless - Main Claude maintains context and routes work

**Context Preservation:** Hook system ensures seamless handoffs between agents

**Quality Assurance:** Binary validation gates (PASS/FAIL) with automatic retry on failure

## Validation Results

### Comprehensive Testing (Tests 1-4)

**Test 1: Simple Edit** ✅
- **Request**: "Add a comment explaining the calculateTotal function"
- **Routing**: Direct → implementation-agent
- **Result**: JSDoc comment added with comprehensive documentation
- **Validation**: Direct routing worked perfectly

**Test 2: Feature Development** ✅  
- **Request**: "Add user login functionality with JWT authentication"

  - 28 granular permissions across 4 categories
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) with inheritance
  - Complete CRUD operations with advanced search and pagination
  - Security validation and integration gate compatibility
- **Validation**: Complex multi-component system delivered with full integration

**Test 4: Enterprise System** ✅
- **Request**: "Build an e-commerce platform with product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, and payment integration"
- **Routing**: PM analysis → TaskMaster integration → 25-task breakdown
- **Result**: Complete project structure with:
  - 10-step enterprise workflow (PM → research → implementation phases → testing → security gate → integration gate)
  - TaskMaster project initialization with complexity analysis
  - Organized development phases (research-phase, implementation-phase, quality-phase, devops-phase)
  - Comprehensive task definitions with dependencies and test strategies
- **Validation**: Enterprise-level project orchestration successful

### Key Technical Achievements

**JSON-Only Workflow Responses:** Strict validation prevents malformed agent responses

**Dependency Management:** Proper execution sequencing with parallel task support

- **Quality/Gate Agents**: Read-only access for validation

## Hook System Architecture

**File**: `.claude/hooks/workflow-coordinator.sh`

**Functionality:**
- **Three-Tier Routing**: Handles direct routing, standard workflows, and PM analysis responses
- **JSON Validation**: Strict schema validation with exit code 2 blocking
- **Workflow Management**: Creates workflow.json files with execution state tracking
- **Dependency Resolution**: Identifies available tasks based on completion status
- **Parallel Execution**: Manages up to 3 concurrent tasks with proper queuing

**Integration Points:**
- **PostToolUse Hook**: Triggers on all Task tool calls
- **Agent Response Processing**: Extracts and validates JSON from agent responses
- **Dynamic Plan Updates**: Updates workflow.json with real-time execution state

## Quick Start

### 1. Install MCP Dependencies
```bash
# Task Master (project coordination)
claude mcp add task-master -s user -- npx -y --package=task-master-ai task-master-ai

# Context7 (library documentation)  
claude mcp add context7 -s user -- npx -y context7-server

# Playwright (browser testing)
claude mcp add playwright -s user -- npx -y playwright-mcp-server
```

### 2. Initialize Project  
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir your-project && cd your-project

# Initialize TaskMaster (for complex projects)
npx task-master-ai init

# Configure for Claude Code (free)
npx task-master-ai models --setMain claude-code/sonnet --setResearch claude-code/sonnet
```

### 3. Make Natural Language Request
Simply talk to Claude:
```
"Build a responsive todo app with dark mode, date functionality, and accessibility compliance"
```

**What happens automatically:**
1. **Workflow-agent** assesses complexity and determines routing path
2. **Direct tasks** → implementation-agent executes immediately
3. **Standard features** → research → implementation → testing pipeline
4. **Complex systems** → PM breakdown → custom workflow creation → phased execution
5. **Hook system** coordinates all agent handoffs and manages workflow state
6. **Quality gates** ensure production readiness with browser validation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Three-Tier Decision Logic

**Workflow Agent Assessment:**
```typescript
// Simple Route Indicators
- Single file edits: "fix typo", "update variable", "change color"
- Clear bounded tasks with obvious implementation path
- No research or multi-step coordination needed

// Standard Pattern Indicators  
- Feature requests: "add login", "implement search", "create form"
- Single-component functionality with known development patterns
- Requires research → implementation → testing sequence

// Complex Route Indicators
- Multi-component systems: "management system", "platform", "dashboard"
- Integration requirements: "with authentication", "and payment processing"
- Project-level requests: "build", "create complete", "full system"
```

### Hook System Data Flow

**Input Processing:**
```bash
# Extract tool response from hook input
TOOL_RESPONSE=$(echo "$INPUT_JSON" | jq -r '.tool_response.content[0].text' 2>/dev/null)

# Handle three routing types
if echo "$TOOL_RESPONSE" | jq -e '.routing == "direct"' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # Direct routing - execute immediately
elif echo "$TOOL_RESPONSE" | jq -e '.routing == "pm_analysis"' >/dev/null 2>&1; then  
    # PM analysis routing - route to project-manager-agent
else
    # Standard workflow - create workflow.json
fi
```

**Workflow Execution:**
```bash
# Get available tasks (no dependencies or dependencies completed)
get_available_tasks() {
    jq -r '. as $root |
        .steps[] | 
        select(.status == "pending") |
        select(
            if (.depends_on | length) == 0 then true
            else (.depends_on | map(. as $dep | 
                ($root.steps[] | select(.id == $dep) | .status == "completed")
            ) | all)
            end
        ) |
        .id
    ' workflow.json 2>/dev/null
}
```

### Agent Response Formats

**Direct Routing:**
```json
{"routing": "direct", "agent": "implementation-agent", "reason": "Simple single-file edit"}
```

**Standard Workflow:**
```json
{
  "task": "Add dark mode toggle to settings page",
  "workflow_type": "standard",
  "status": "pending",
  "current_step": 1,
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "agent": "research-agent",
      "task": "Research dark mode implementation patterns",
      "status": "pending",
      "depends_on": [],
      "can_run_parallel": false
    }
  ]
}
```

**PM Analysis Routing:**
```json
{"routing": "pm_analysis", "reason": "Multi-component system requiring expert breakdown"}
```

## Research Findings & Design Decisions

### Why Three-Tier Architecture

**Problem**: Previous hardcoded complexity levels (1-4) created artificial constraints and routing inefficiencies.

**Solution**: Pure need-based assessment with intelligent routing eliminates artificial complexity boundaries.

**Research Basis**: 
- Industry analysis of enterprise workflow orchestration patterns
- Study of BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) standards
- Evaluation of microservices orchestration vs choreography patterns

**Decision**: Hybrid approach combining centralized routing (orchestration) with distributed execution (choreography)

### Why Hook-Based Coordination

**Problem**: Agent coordination required manual context passing and state management.

**Solution**: PostToolUse hooks provide automatic agent coordination with persistent state.

**Research Basis**:
- Analysis of CI/CD pipeline hook systems (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Study of event-driven architecture patterns
- Evaluation of workflow engines (Apache Airflow, Kubernetes workflows)

**Decision**: File-based workflow state with hook-driven execution provides reliability and transparency

### Why JSON-Only Agent Responses

**Problem**: Mixed text/JSON responses caused parsing failures and workflow inconsistencies.

**Solution**: Strict JSON-only responses with schema validation and exit code 2 blocking.

**Research Basis**:
- API design best practices (REST, GraphQL standards)
- Study of data serialization formats and error handling
- Analysis of microservices communication patterns

**Decision**: Fail-fast validation with clear error boundaries improves system reliability

### Security Architecture

**JWT Implementation**: Hybrid approach with dual-token pattern (access + refresh tokens)
- **Research**: Analysis of OAuth 2.1, OIDC specifications, and enterprise security patterns
- **Decision**: Balance of security and usability with proper token lifecycle management

**RBAC System**: Hierarchical role-based access control with 28 granular permissions  
- **Research**: Study of NIST RBAC standard, enterprise identity management patterns
- **Decision**: Scalable permission model supporting both hierarchical and flat role structures

**Input Validation**: Multi-layer validation with express-validator and custom business logic
- **Research**: OWASP security guidelines, injection attack prevention patterns
- **Decision**: Defense-in-depth approach with comprehensive sanitization

## Tested Capabilities

**Validated System Types:**
- Authentication systems (JWT, session management, MFA)
- User management (RBAC, permissions, audit logging)
- Frontend applications (React, Vue, Angular, Vanilla JS)
