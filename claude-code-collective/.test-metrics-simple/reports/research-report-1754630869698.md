**Evidence:**
- Memory usage reduced by 49.1%

### Hub-and-Spoke Coordination
**Status:** IN_PROGRESS
**Description:** Centralized hub-and-spoke coordination outperforms distributed peer-to-peer communication

**Evidence:**
- Zero peer-to-peer communication violations detected

### Test-Driven Development Handoffs
**Status:** IN_PROGRESS
**Description:** Test-driven development handoffs improve quality and reduce errors compared to traditional methods

**Evidence:**
- Error reduction achieved 100.0% (target: 50.0%)
- Quality score improved by 80.0%
